   phi4-n-particle:
======================

This code allows to generate complex phi4 field configurations and to calculate the corresponding n particle correlation
functions. It consists of the following components:

- complex.cpp
  ===========
  Contains the functions for the calculation of the complex product, conjugate and power function as well as the
  function for the substraction of two complex numbers

- scalar.cpp
  ==========
  Contains different functions for calculating, copying and updating lattice points, initializing, copying and printing
  the lattice field as well as reading in the start configuration

- action.cpp
  ==========
  Contains the functions for the calculation of the action S and the change in action \Delta S required in
  "metropolis.cpp"

- metropolis.cpp
  ==============
  Contains the metropolis algorithm which is required in "calculate_toytest.cpp" in the course of the calculation of
  field configurations

- calculate_toytest.cpp
  =====================
  Executes the creation of "n_save" field configuration files "scalar_X_Y_Z_T_(n_conf).txt" which are read in in
  "calculate_corr.cpp" in order to calculate the n particle correlators

- correlators.cpp
  ===============
  Contains the function for the calculation of the n particle correlation function

- calculate_corr.cpp
  ==================
  Executes the calculation of the n particle correlation function by calling the function "correlator_n()" included in
  "correlators.cpp"


Random numbers, which are needed to initialize the lattice field, to update a field point (scalar.cpp) as well as to run
the metropolis algorithm (metropolis.cpp), are created via the standard cpp mersenne twister "mt19937"
(see generator_singleton.h).

In order to run the program:
Choose your parameters in "parameters.h" and type "./toytest" to create new field configurations or "./corr" to
calculate the correlators from those configurations.
